Write tests for the following, and then make the tests pass!

`capitalize` function that takes a string and returns it with the first character capitalized.

`reverseString` function that takes a string and returns it reversed.

`calculator` object that contains functions for the basic operations: `add`, `subtract`, `divide`, and `multiply`. Each of these functions should take two numbers and return the correct calculation.

`caesarCipher` function that takes a string and a shift factor and returns it with each character “shifted”.

`analyzeArray` function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with the following properties: `average`, `min`, `max`, and `length`.

<pre>
const object = analyzeArray([1,8,3,4,2,6]);

object == {
  average: 4,
  min: 1,
  max: 8,
  length: 6
};
</pre>
